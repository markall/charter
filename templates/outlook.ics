The best meeting time seems to be the morning of the 9th so I have confirmed that. Mark hasn=27t responded but hopefully he make this or ChrisR can cover for him. Let me know please, Mark or ChrisR, if this is a problem.=0D=0A=0D=0AWe probably need to think a bit harder about venue. Would it be useful to be able to see the site as we talk? If so maybe the Open Learning Centre would be a better option, if we can get a room. =0D=0A=0D=0ARegards, Robert=0D=0A=0D=0A-- previous message --=0D=0APlease use www.meetingwizard.com to indicate which dates you can make for a meeting to finalise the new Careers Springboard Bracknell website.
